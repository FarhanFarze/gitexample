        European Central Bank policymakers are increasingly wondering if they may only be able to cut interest rates once more this year, 
        according to people familiar with the matter.With inflation pressures still lingering, 
        officials are becoming less confident that a path for two further reductions is realistic, 
        and don’t want investors to assume that a move in September is a done deal, 
        said the people,who declined to be identified because deliberations are private.
        Policymakers’ experience of having made too strong a commitment to move in June — when they cut the ECB’s 
        deposit rate by a quarter point to 3.75% even after an acceleration in price growth — are also motivating them 
        to keep all options available for the upcoming decision on Sept. 12, according to the people. They kept rates unchanged at their most recent gathering on Thursday.</p>
